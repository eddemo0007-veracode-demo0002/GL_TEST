Version 00.00.0001

Notes:

It seems like the Veracode Static Scan, using Veracode's Plugin, is trying 
to find gradlew in your current directory rather than in the directories 
listed in my PATH environment variable.

I was able to get it to do a Static Scan by adding ./ to the beginning of
the gradlew command:

    ./gradlew clean build -x test 

To run the Veracode Static Scan, I ran the following temporary command:

    export PATH=$PATH:/Users/EGannaway/Documents/eddemo0007-veracode-demos0002/GL_TEST 

Once the above command ran I could run the Veracode Static Scan using 
the Veracode Visual Code Plugin.
